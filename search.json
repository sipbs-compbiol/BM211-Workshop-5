Basic competence and skills in R are in high demand in academia and industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can produce equivalent trees to those you will produce in these exercises using standalone tools like figtree and dendroscope. Some tree visualisations can only be achieved in specialised packages, or with tools like ggtree.\nggtree is an R package that extends the ggplot2 data visualisation package to visualise and annotate phylogenetic trees (or any other tree-like structure!).\n\nggtree homepage\nThe ggtree book",

    "text": "2.3 Understanding your tree\nConsidering the newick file contents you saw in Chapter 1 (and shown below), you might expect that the tree shows relationships between species represented by the letters A-M in that file:\n(((((((A:4,B:4):6,C:5):8,D:6):3,E:21):10,((F:4,G:12):14,H:8):13):13,((I:5,J:2):30,(K:11,L:11):2):17):4,M:56);\nThe tree iTol presents at first (Figure 2.5) shows these relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Rectangular phylogram representation of the tree_newick.nwk file.\n\n\n\n\nthe tree is a set of bifurcating branches that spread out from the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) and represent an estimated evolutionary history\nthis is a rooted tree, so the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) is considered to be represented at the very far left of the tree, at its root\n\nin this tree, ancestors are on the left, and descendants are on the right\n\nthe horizontal dimension in this plot shows the amount of genetic change since the MRCA - less change towards the left-hand side, more towards the right\n\nthis tree is a phylogram, which means that the lengths of the branches are meaningful and represent the amount of genetic change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBranch lengths are usually drawn in units of substitutions per site - the estimated total number of nucleotide substitutions, divided by (normalised to) the length of the sequence.\nYou may sometimes see alternative units being used, such as estimated time, or the percentage of sites that have changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 01\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 2.5 which species shows the most genetic change since the MRCA?\n\nA\nE\nG\nK\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1 Trees and time\nThe general relationship between the phylogram you have made and time is shown in Figure 2.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: iToL phylogram annotated with root, leaves, bifurcations, and the relationship between ancestors and descendents.\n\n\n\nAs the tree represents genetic change, and the rate of genetic change may not be constant in all sequences or organisms, we can’t immediately interpret branch lengths in terms of elapsed time. But, when the sequences/organisms used to build the tree are known to exist now, we can say that the leaves of the tree approximately represent the current date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are phylogenetic techniques that allow us to convert genetic distances into approximate times, but they are beyond the scope of this workshop.\n\n\n\ncurrently existing species (A-M) - the input for building the tree - are shown at the leaves (or leaf nodes) of the tree, at the ends of the branches\nthe branching events (bifurcations) show how evolutionary lineages split, as the amount of genetic change increases from left to right; they represent events in evolution where a population divides into two subgroups with different genetic histories\n\nin a biological context, this process is often referred to as speciation\nthe order of bifurcation can be interpreted as the order in which speciation events occurred\n\nthe amount of genetic change between branching events is represented by the length of the branch that separates them; the scale bar allows you to interpret the branch length quantitatively\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 02\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5 implies that which speciation event was the earliest?\n\nthe speciation separating A and B\nthe speciation separating B and C\nthe speciation separating B and D\nthe speciation separating C and E\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Ancestry and history\nPhylogenetic trees represent patterns of shared ancestry and history between lineages. For instance, in Figure 2.7 common and unique ancestors of A, B and C are indicated, as are common and unique histories of I and J.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: iToL phylogram annotated with unique and shared ancestries and histories. Ancestors are single points on a branch (represented here as boxes), whereas histories are the entire set of ancestors represented by a branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 03\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 2.5 which of the following accumulated the greatest amount of genetic change?\n\nthe unique history of E\nthe shared history of I and J\nthe shared history of I, J, K, and L\nthe unique history of D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Clades\nA clade is a grouping on the tree that includes a common ancestor and all of its descendants. We call a group with these properties monophyletic (i.e. it comprises a single phylum). Figure 2.8 shows examples of clades in the iToL tree you generated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: iToL phylogram annotated with clades, groupings on the tree that include a common ancestor and all its descendants. Clades can be nested inside each other as a hierarchy. Clade4 (A, B, C) is completely contained within Clade3 (A, B, C, D, E).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 04\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 2.5 which of the following groups of leaf nodes form a clade?\n\n(J, K, L)\n(F, G, H)\n(D, E)\n(K, L)",

These place the root at the centre of a circle and show the branches as radii with branching points moving away from the centre as genetic changes increase.\nRendering a tree in circular form does not change the information being presented, in comparison with a rectangular phylogram, as can be seen in Figure 3.13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Rectangular phylogram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Circular phylogram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.13: A rectangular and a circular phylogram of the same phylogenetic tree, presenting identical evolutionary information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawing a circular phylogram in iToL\n\n\n\n\n\nTo generate a circular phylogram in iTol, select Circular mode in the Basic tab, and ensure that Branch lengths is set to Use:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.14: Use the Circular mode to generate a circular tree in iToL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros and cons of circular phylograms\n\n\n\n\n\nPros\n\nCircular trees are efficient with space\nCircular trees are especially useful for fitting large trees into a small space, such as a journal page.\n\nCons\n\nIt can be difficult to read the labels on circular trees easily\nDue to the way they are presented, especially for trees with lots of data, it can be difficult to see the branching order of nodes close to the root.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.3 Unrooted trees\nAll the trees you have seen so far have an implied root - a single ancestral point from which all the sequences or species represented on the tree have descended. In terms of all like on Earth, we would call this root the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA). For most trees we work with as scientists, the common ancestor would be much more recent than LUCA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRooted vs Unrooted Trees\n\n\n\n\n\nSome tree reconstruction methods, such as UPGMA or Neighbour-Joining (NJ) automatically produce rooted trees, because of the way their algorithms work.\nOther, more accurate and precise, phylogenetic reconstruction methods such as Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian approaches produce unrooted trees. These methods do not tell the user where the root of the tree is likely to be, so we often include an outgroup - a species/sequence, or set of species/sequences that we already believe to be ancestral to the part of the tree we’re more focused on. This allows us to determine the most likely order of divergenece in that part of the tree.\nFor example, if we wanted to produce a phylogenetic tree for primates, we would choose an outgroup such as lagomorphs (rabbits, hares, etc.) oor colugos (Dermoptera), that diverged from an earlier common ancestor with primates (Perelman et al. (2011)).\n\n\n\nUnrooted trees, like that in Figure 3.15, appear to extend out from a central point, but that central point may or may not be the real root of the tree. In Figure 3.15, the rectangular tree implies that the root, i.e. the point at which the last common ancestor diverged into the ancestor of M and the ancestor of the remaining species, lies somewhere between M and the last common ancestor of J and D, not at the central junction in the tree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Rectangular phylogram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Unrooted phylogram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.15: Rectangular and unrooted phylograms of the same phylogeny.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawing an unrooted tree in iToL\n\n\n\n\n\nTo generate an unrooted tree in iTol, select Unrooted mode in the Basic tab:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.16: Use the Circular mode to generate an unrooted tree in iToL",

The pathogen itself has the capability to infect a range of human cells and evade the immune system, in part because it produces proteins called effectors: these are proteins adapted to interfere with host biology and make the environment more favourable for the bacterium.\nThe protein you are studying, BipC, is such an effector protein. Specifically, it is a translocator protein that makes holes in the host’s cells, allowing its own effector proteins to enter and manipulate host biochemistry, and also binds to actin microfilaments, disrupting host cell structure.\nYou would like to understand the evolution of this protein, to see whether the knowledge can help you design drug compounds that interfere with the action of BipC as a treatment for melioidosis. To do this, you will produce a phylogenetic tree for the protein.",

It is incorrect to talk about gradation or percentage of homology (though you will encounter people doing so).\n\n\nUniProt provides a precomputed cluster of all the proteins it knows about that are potentially homologous to any other protein sequence in its database, and you can find this by clicking on the Similar Proteins link in the sidebar of the record page. This will take you to a table of similar protein sequences (Figure 4.4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: The Similar Proteins table for Q62B08\n\n\n\nThis table has three tabs: 100% identity, 90% identity, and 50% identity.

It wouldn’t be reasonable to compare organ structure with skull shape, say.In the same way, for biological sequence data, we want to compare genetic changes at equivalent sites, which means we have to find which sites are equivalent before we build the tree.\nWe find equivalent sites by aligning sequences against each other in a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA). Detailed accounts of the methods involved in multiple sequence alignment are beyond the scope of the course, but they can be similar in some cases to the pairwise sequence alignment process that you have already seen in BM214.\nYou are going to employ a widely-used research tool called MUSCLE to make a multiple sequence alignment from the sequences in the cluster you downloaded.

There are two groups of sequences - one closely related (on the left), and one more distantly related (on the right)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe unrooted tree suggests that there might be two distinct groups of sequences, but this information looks to be masked in the default rectangular tree, so we will try re-rooting it for clarity.\n\n\nA common approach to initial rooting of a tree, where an outgroup was not included in the analysis, is to use midpoint rooting. Midpoint rooting assumes that the root of the tree is halfway between the two most distantly-related sequences or species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMidpoint rooting in iTol\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use midpoint rooting in iTol\n\nSelect the Advanced tab from the control panel\nClick on Midpoint root in the Other functions section\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: iTol’s advanced control panel tab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nUse iToL’s Midpoint Rooting to modify the layout of your tree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your result\n\n\n\n\n\nYour midpoint-rooted tree should look something like that in Figure 5.4 There is a group of recently-diverged sequences (sharing a recent common ancestor with short branches), and a group of more anciently-diverged sequences (sharing a recent common ancestor with longer branches).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Midpoint-rooted Simple Phylogeny tree for BipC generated in iTol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAfter midpoint rooting the tree, we might consider that there are two clades of interest - a recently-rooted clade, and a more anciently-rooted clade. It might be worth colouring these sequence groups in the figure, so we can refer a reader to them.",

    "text": "5.4 Gene trees and species trees\nAny phylogenetic tree we generate reflects only the data used to construct it. If we use sequences corresponding to a single gene or gene product, as we did for BipC, we generate a history only for that gene/gene product - this is called a gene tree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe might assume that genes are transmitted vertically from parent to offspring but, in most life on Earth - i.e. microbial life, genes can also be transmitted horizontally and recombined into a different organism, maybe even a different species.\nWe cannot always assume that the history of a gene exactly represents the history of the organism it is currently found in.\n\n\nAs the history of any particular gene may not be the same as that of the organism it is found in, we have developed alternative approaches to construct species trees that are more reflective of the evolution of the species as a whole. These approaches are out of scope for this workshop, but include:\n\nwhole-genome SNP trees\nmultigene phylogenetic trees, essentially averaging over many single gene trees\n\nwhere a multigene tree includes every homologous gene across all the organisms involved, it is called a core gene phylogeny.\n\nwhole-genome distance measures, like Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) or digital DNA-DNA hybridisation (dDDH)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWe would like to know how similar our BipC gene tree is to the known species tree for the organisms represented in it. We can tell which organisms are present in the tree by looking at the annotation label, specifically the final few characters:\n\n9BURK: B. mayonis, B. humptydooensis, B. oklahomensis, Burkholderia sp.\nBURM7: B. mallei\nBURM9: B. mallei\nBURMA: B. mallei\nBURML: B. mallei\nBURP0: B. pseudomallei\nBURP1: B. pseudomallei\nBURP2: B. pseudomallei\nBURPS: B. pseudomallei\nBURP6: B. pseudomallei\nBURPB: B. pseudomallei\nBURPE: B. pseudomallei\nBURTA: B. thailandensis\nBURTH: B. thailandensis\n\n\n\nA core gene tree has been produced for this group of organisms - the B. pseudomallei complex (Hall et al. (2022)), and can be seen in Figure 5.8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.8: Core genome phylogeny of 66 strains in the B. pseudomallei complex. This maximum-likelihood phylogeny was created using core genome SNPs shared by all strains and rooted on B. ubonensis strain MSMB22 as an outgroup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion questions\n\n\n\nCompare the tree in Figure 5.8 to the tree you have produced from BipC.\n\nHow are the trees similar?\nHow do the trees differ?\n\nB. mallei (glanders) and B. pseudomallei are the only pathogenic members of the B. pseudomallei complex (Janesomboon et al. (2021)). BipC is an effector protein that promotes infection of human and animal hosts.\n\nConsidered in the context of the core genome tree in Figure 5.8, what does your tree suggest about the evolution of BipC?",
