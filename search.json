    "text": "Overview\nThis workshop asks you to work through some computational exercises to gain some practice visualising and working with phylogenetic trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPhylogenetic trees are typically constructed after sequence alignment has been performed. You learned about the fundamentals of (pairwise) sequence alignment in BM214 Workshop 2 - slides, workshop. You may find it useful to refresh your memory about pairwise alignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Note\n\n\n\nThere is new material in this workshop that is not covered in lectures, and this material is examinable. Please take care to reach the text in the expandable callout boxes, as well as that for the workshop activities, to be sure you have understood the topic and obtain full value from the exercises.",

Some of these can be downloaded and run on your own computer, such as:\n\nfigtree this is the one I use most often - LP\ndendroscope\n\nbut the interactive Tree of Life (iTol) service allows you, once you register and sign in, to edit trees directly in the browser. Traditionally, phylogenetic trees have been visualised using independent software tools like these.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIn this workshop we will be using the online iToL service to visualise and interpret trees.\n\n\nThe R software ecosystem is a very powerful tool for computational biology and bioinformatics work, encompassing sequence analysis and genomics, transcriptomic and evolutionary analyses, with excellent visualisation capabilities. As R is also a programming language, large parts of the analysis can be automated and made reproducible, which is an advantage over independent tools, and a factor in the growing popularity of this approach. Basic competence and skills in R are in high demand in academia and industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can produce equivalent trees to those you will produce in these exercises using standalone tools like figtree and dendroscope. Some tree visualisations can only be achieved in specialised packages, or with tools like ggtree.\nggtree is an R packages that extends the ggplot2 data visualisation package to visualise and annotate phylogenetic trees (or any other tree-like structure!).\n\nggtree homepage\nThe ggtree book",

In iToL you would need to upload the data to the server. In figtree or dendroscope you would open the file through a dialogue box.
