Some of these can be downloaded and run on your own computer, such as:\n\nfigtree this is the one I use most often - LP\ndendroscope\n\nbut the interactive Tree of Life (iTol) service allows you, once you register and sign in, to edit trees directly in the browser.

As R is also a programming language, large parts of the analysis can be automated and made reproducible, which is an advantage over independent tools, and a factor in the growing popularity of this approach. Basic competence and skills in R are in high demand in academia and industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can produce equivalent trees to those you will produce in these exercises using standalone tools like figtree and dendroscope. Some tree visualisations can only be achieved in specialised packages, or with tools like ggtree.\nggtree is an R packages that extends the ggplot2 data visualisation package to visualise and annotate phylogenetic trees (or any other tree-like structure!).\n\nggtree homepage\nThe ggtree book",

    "section": "2.3 Understanding your tree",
    "text": "2.3 Understanding your tree\nConsidering the newick file contents you saw in Chapter 1 (and shown below), you might expect that the tree shows relationships between species represented by the letters A-M in that file:\n(((((((A:4,B:4):6,C:5):8,D:6):3,E:21):10,((F:4,G:12):14,H:8):13):13,((I:5,J:2):30,(K:11,L:11):2):17):4,M:56);\nThe tree iTol presents at first (Figure 2.5) shows these relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Rectangular phylogram representation of the tree_newick.nwk file.\n\n\n\n\nthe tree is a set of bifurcating branches that spread out from the last common ancestor (LCA) and represent an estimated evolutionary history\nthis is a rooted tree, so the last common ancestor (LCA) is considered to be represented at the very far left of the tree, at its root\n\nin this tree, ancestors are on the left, and descendants are on the right\n\nthe horizontal dimension in this plot shows the amount of genetic change since the LCA - less change towards the left-hand side, more towards the right\n\nthis tree is a phylogram, which means that the lengths of the branches are meaningful and represent the amount of genetic change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBranch lengths are usually drawn in units of nucleotide substitutions per site - the estimated total number of nucleotide substitutions, divided by (normalised to) the length of the sequence.\nYou may sometimes see alternative units being used, such as estimated time, or the percentage of sites that have changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 01\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 2.5 which species shows the most genetic change since the LCA?\n\nA\nE\nG\nK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer 01\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total distance from the LCA to the leaf node for a species represents the total amount of genetic change. More straightforwardly here, the species whose leaf node is farthest to the right in Figure 2.5 has accumulated the most genetic change since the LCA. Of the four options presented, the species with greatest genetic change since the LCA is G.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1 Trees and time\nThe general relationship between this phylogram and time is shown in Figure 2.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: iToL phylogram annotated with root, leaves, bifurcations, and the relationship between ancestors and descendents.\n\n\n\nAs the tree represents genetic change, and the rate of genetic change may not be constant in all sequences or organisms, we can’t immediately interpret branch lengths as time. The best we can sometimes do is - when the sequences/organisms used to build the tree are known to exist now - say that the leaves of the tree approximately represent the current date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are phylogenetic techniques that allow us to convert genetic distances into approximate times, but they are beyond the scope of this workshop.\n\n\n\ncurrently existing species (A-M) - the input for building the tree - are shown at the leaves (or leaf nodes) of the tree, at the ends of the branches\nthe branching events (bifurcations) show how evolutionary lineages split, as the amount of genetic change increases from left to right; they represent events in evolution where a population divides into two subgroups with different genetic histories\n\nin a biological context, this process is often referred to as speciation\nthe order of bifurcation can be interpreted as the order in which speciation events occurred\n\nthe amount of genetic change between branching events is represented by the length of the branch that separates them; the scale bar allows you to interpret the branch length quantitatively\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 02\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5 implies that which speciation event was the earliest?\n\nthe speciation separating A and B\nthe speciation separating B and C\nthe speciation separating B and D\nthe speciation separating C and E\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer 02\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have to be careful with the interpretation because the lengths of branches represent genetic change, not time. However, moving from left to right we can see that A, B, C, D, and E derived from a single common ancestor. The order in which the individual species emerged is the order of speciations from left to right in this tree. So, E diverged first, then D, C, B and A in that order. The earliest specietion is the one involving species E, so the answer is the speciation separating C and E.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Ancestry and history\nPhylogenetic trees represent patterns of shared ancestry and history between lineages. For instance, in Figure 2.7 common and unique ancestors of A, B and C are indicated, as are common and unique histories of I and J.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: iToL phylogram annotated with unique and shared ancestries and histories. Ancestors are single points on a branch (represented here as boxes), whereas histories are the entire set of ancestors represented by a branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 03\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 2.5 which of the following accumulated the greatest amount of genetic change?\n\nthe unique history of E\nthe shared history of I and J\nthe shared history of I, J, K, and L\nthe unique history of D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer 03\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom those listed, the branch that accumulated the most genetic change is the longest of the branches. The shared history of I and J is the longest of these, so has accumulated the most genetic change.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Clades\nA clade is a grouping on the tree that includes a common ancestor and all of its descendants. We call a group with these properties monpphyletic (i.e. it comprises a single phylum). Figure 2.8 shows examples of clades in the iToL tree you generated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: iToL phylogram annotated with clades, groupings on the tree that include a common ancestor and all its descendants. Clades can be nested inside each other as a hierarchy. Clade4 (A, B, C) is completely contained within Clade3 (A, B, C, D, E).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 04\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 2.5 which of the following groups of leaf nodes form a clade?\n\n(J, K, L)\n(F, G, H)\n(D, E)\n(K, L)\n\n\nall of the groups form a clade\nonly groups 1 and 4 form clades\nonly groups 2 and 4 form clades\nonly group 1 forms a clade\nonly group 2 forms a clade\nonly group 3 forms a clade\nonly group 4 forms a clade\nonly groups 2 and 3 form clades\nnone of the groups form a clade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer 04\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup 1, (J, K, L) does not form a clade because the common ancestor of these species also has I as a descendent, and it is not included in the group.\nGroup 2, (F, G, H) forms a clade (see Figure 2.8).\nGroup 3, (D, E) does not form a clade because the common ancestor of these species also has A , B, and C as descendents, and they are not included in the group.\nGroup 4, (K, L) does form a clade as K, L and all descendants from their common ancestor are included.\nThus, the answer is only groups 2 and 4 form clades.",

These place the root at the centre of a circle and show the branches as radii with branching points moving away from the centre as genetic changes increase.\nRendering a tree in circular form does not change the information being presented, in comparison with a rectangular phylogram, as can be seen in Figure 3.13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Rectangular phylogram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Circular phylogram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.13: A rectangular and a circular phylogram of the same phylogenetic tree, presenting identical evolutionary information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawing a circular phylogram in iToL\n\n\n\n\n\nTo generate a circular phylogram in iTol, select Circular mode in the Basic tab, and ensure that Branch lengths is set to Use:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.14: Use the Circular mode to generate a circular tree in iToL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros and cons of circular phylograms\n\n\n\n\n\nPros\n\nCircular trees are efficient with space\nCircular trees are especially useful for fitting large trees into a small space, such as a journal page.\n\nCons\n\nIt can be difficult to read the labels on circular trees easily\nDue to the way they are presented, especially for trees with lots of data, it can be difficult to see the branching order of nodes close to the root.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.3 Unrooted trees\nAll the trees you have seen so far have an implied root - a single ancestral point from which all the sequences or species represented on the tree have descended. In terms of all like on Earth, we would call this root the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA). For most trees we work with as scientists, the common ancestor would be much more recent than LUCA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRooted vs Unrooted Trees\n\n\n\n\n\nSome tree reconstruction methods, such as UPGMA or Neighbour-Joining (NJ) automatically produce rooted trees, because of the way their algorithms work.\nOther, more accurate and precise, phylogenetic reconstruction methods such as Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian approaches produce unrooted trees. These methods do not tell the user where the root of the tree is likely to be, so we often include an outgroup - a species/sequence, or set of species/sequences that we already believe to be ancestral to the part of the tree we’re more focused on. This allows us to determine the most likely order of divergenece in that part of the tree.\nFor example, if we wanted to produce a phylogenetic tree for primates, we would choose an outgroup such as lagomorphs (rabbits, hares, etc.) oor colugos (Dermoptera), that diverged from an earlier common ancestor with primates (Perelman et al. (2011)).\n\n\n\nUnrooted trees, like that in Figure 3.15, appear to extend out from a central point, but that central point may or may not be the real root of the tree. In Figure 3.15, the rectangular tree implies that the root, i.e. the point at which the last common ancestor diverged into the ancestor of M and the ancestor of the remaining species, lies somewhere between M and the last common ancestor of J and D, not at the central junction in the tree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Rectangular phylogram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Unrooted phylogram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.15: Rectangular and unrooted phylograms of the same phylogeny.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawing an unrooted tree in iToL\n\n\n\n\n\nTo generate an unrooted tree in iTol, select Unrooted mode in the Basic tab:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.16: Use the Circular mode to generate an unrooted tree in iToL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerelman, Polina, Warren E Johnson, Christian Roos, Hector N Seuánez, Julie E Horvath, Miguel A M Moreira, Bailey Kessing, et al. 2011. “A Molecular Phylogeny of Living Primates.” PLoS Genet. 7 (3): e1001342.",

Depending on whether you live in a medically well-resourced, or poorly-resourced, area the risk of death from infection varies from 10%-40%. The pathogen itself has the capability to infect a range of human cells and evade the immune system, in part because it produces proteins called effectors: these are proteins adapted to interfere with host biology and make the environment more favourable for the bacterium.\nThe protein you are studying, BipC, is such an effector protein. Specifically, it is a translocator protein that makes holes in the host’s cells, allowing its own effector proteins to enter and manipulate host biochemistry, and also binds to actin microfilaments, disrupting host cell structure.\nYou would like to understand the evolution of this protein, to see whether the knowledge can help you design drug compounds that interfere with the action of BipC as a treatment for melioidosis.",

Two sequences are either homologous to each other, or they are not. It is incorrect to talk about gradation or percentage of homology.\n\n\nUniProt provides a precomputed cluster of all the proteins it knows about that are potentially homologous to any other protein sequence in its database, and you can find this by clicking on the Similar Proteins link in the sidebar of the record page. This will take you to a table of similar protein sequences (Figure 4.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: The Similar Proteins table for Q62B08\n\n\n\nThis table has three tabs: 100% identity, 90% identity, and 50% identity.

    "text": "4.3 Make a multiple sequence alignment\nThe sequences in the cluster you have downloaded from UniProt are different lengths, and are not identical to each other.\nIf we were to compare animal body parts to understand their evolution, we would naturally try to compare only equivalent elements, such as forelimbs, with each other. It wouldn’t be reasonable to compare organ structure with skull shape, say.In the same way, for biological sequence data, we want to compare genetic changes at equivalent sites, which means we have to find which sites are equivalent before we build the tree.\nWe find equivalent sites by aligning sequences against each other in a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA). The methods involved in multiple sequence alignment are beyond the scope of the course, but they can be similar in some cases to the pairwise sequence alignment that you have already seen.\nYou are going to use a widely-used research tool called MUSCLE to make a multiple sequence alignment from the sequences in the cluster you downloaded. This program is availble to install on your own computer, but can also be used through an online service (Figure 4.6).\n\nMUSCLE online service: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/msa/muscle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: MUSCLE online service landing page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nUse the online MUSCLE service to generate a multiple sequence alignment from your cluster sequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI need a hint!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the MUSCLE service landing page, click on Browse… and use the dialogue box that appears to navigate to your downloaded cluster sequences.\nScroll down the page and click Submit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your result\n\n\n\n\n\nYour alignment should look similar to the one in Figure 4.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: MUSCLE multiple sequence alignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe output from the online tool can be very helpful.
