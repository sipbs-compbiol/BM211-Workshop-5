    "text": "Overview\nThis workshop asks you to work through some computational exercises to gain some practice visualising and working with phylogenetic trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPhylogenetic trees are typically constructed after sequence alignment has been performed. You learned about the fundamentals of (pairwise) sequence alignment in BM214 Workshop 2 - slides, workshop. You may find it useful to refresh your memory about pairwise alignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Note\n\n\n\nThere is new material in this workshop that is not covered in lectures, and this material is examinable. Please take care to reach the text in the expandable callout boxes, as well as that for the workshop activities, to be sure you have understood the topic and obtain full value from the exercises.",

Some of these can be downloaded and run on your own computer, such as:\n\nfigtree this is the one I use most often - LP\ndendroscope\n\nbut the interactive Tree of Life (iTol) service allows you, once you register and sign in, to edit trees directly in the browser. Traditionally, phylogenetic trees have been visualised using independent software tools like these.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIn this workshop we will be using the online iToL service to visualise and interpret trees.\n\n\nThe R software ecosystem is a very powerful tool for computational biology and bioinformatics work, encompassing sequence analysis and genomics, transcriptomic and evolutionary analyses, with excellent visualisation capabilities. As R is also a programming language, large parts of the analysis can be automated and made reproducible, which is an advantage over independent tools, and a factor in the growing popularity of this approach. Basic competence and skills in R are in high demand in academia and industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can produce equivalent trees to those you will produce in these exercises using standalone tools like figtree and dendroscope. Some tree visualisations can only be achieved in specialised packages, or with tools like ggtree.\nggtree is an R packages that extends the ggplot2 data visualisation package to visualise and annotate phylogenetic trees (or any other tree-like structure!).\n\nggtree homepage\nThe ggtree book",

    "section": "2.3 Understanding your tree",
    "text": "2.3 Understanding your tree\nConsidering the newick file contents you saw in Chapter 1 (and shown below), you might expect that the tree shows relationships between species represented by the letters A-M in that file:\n(((((((A:4,B:4):6,C:5):8,D:6):3,E:21):10,((F:4,G:12):14,H:8):13):13,((I:5,J:2):30,(K:11,L:11):2):17):4,M:56);\nThe tree iTol presents at first (Figure 2.5) shows these relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Rectangular phylogram representation of the tree_newick.nwk file.\n\n\n\n\nthe tree is a set of bifurcating branches that spread out from the last common ancestor (LCA) and represent an estimated evolutionary history\nthis is a rooted tree, so the last common ancestor (LCA) is considered to be represented at the very far left of the tree, at its root\n\nin this tree, ancestors are on the left, and descendants are on the right\n\nthe horizontal dimension in this plot shows the amount of genetic change since the LCA - less change towards the left-hand side, more towards the right\n\nthis tree is a phylogram, which means that the lengths of the branches are meaningful and represent the amount of genetic change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBranch lengths are usually drawn in units of nucleotide substitutions per site - the estimated total number of nucleotide substitutions, divided by (normalised to) the length of the sequence.\nYou may sometimes see alternative units being used, such as estimated time, or the percentage of sites that have changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 01\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 2.5 which species shows the most genetic change since the LCA?\n\nA\nE\nG\nK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer 01\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total distance from the LCA to the leaf node for a species represents the total amount of genetic change. More straightforwardly here, the species whose leaf node is farthest to the right in Figure 2.5 has accumulated the most genetic change since the LCA. Of the four options presented, the species with greatest genetic change since the LCA is G.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1 Trees and time\nThe general relationship between this phylogram and time is shown in Figure 2.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: iToL phylogram annotated with root, leaves, bifurcations, and the relationship between ancestors and descendents.\n\n\n\nAs the tree represents genetic change, and the rate of genetic change may not be constant in all sequences or organisms, we can’t immediately interpret branch lengths as time. The best we can sometimes do is - when the sequences/organisms used to build the tree are known to exist now - say that the leaves of the tree approximately represent the current date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are phylogenetic techniques that allow us to convert genetic distances into approximate times, but they are beyond the scope of this workshop.\n\n\n\ncurrently existing species (A-M) - the input for building the tree - are shown at the leaves (or leaf nodes) of the tree, at the ends of the branches\nthe branching events (bifurcations) show how evolutionary lineages split, as the amount of genetic change increases from left to right; they represent events in evolution where a population divides into two subgroups with different genetic histories\n\nin a biological context, this process is often referred to as speciation\nthe order of bifurcation can be interpreted as the order in which speciation events occurred\n\nthe amount of genetic change between branching events is represented by the length of the branch that separates them; the scale bar allows you to interpret the branch length quantitatively\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 02\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5 implies that which speciation event was the earliest?\n\nthe speciation separating A and B\nthe speciation separating B and C\nthe speciation separating B and D\nthe speciation separating C and E\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer 02\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have to be careful with the interpretation because the lengths of branches represent genetic change, not time. However, moving from left to right we can see that A, B, C, D, and E derived from a single common ancestor. The order in which the individual species emerged is the order of speciations from left to right in this tree. So, E diverged first, then D, C, B and A in that order. The earliest specietion is the one involving species E, so the answer is the speciation separating C and E.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Ancestry and history\nPhylogenetic trees represent patterns of shared ancestry and history between lineages. For instance, in Figure 2.7 common and unique ancestors of A, B and C are indicated, as are common and unique histories of I and J.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: iToL phylogram annotated unique and shared ancestries and histories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 03\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 2.5 which of the following accumulated the greatest amount of genetic change?\n\nthe unique history of E\nthe shared history of I and J\nthe shared history of I, J, K, and L\nthe unique history of D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer 03\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom those listed, the branch that accumulated the most genetic change is the longest of the branches. The shared history of I and J is the longest of these, so has accumulated the most genetic change.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Clades",
