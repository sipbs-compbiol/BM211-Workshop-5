  abstract  = "Summary We present an r package, ggtree, which provides
               programmable visualization and annotation of phylogenetic trees.
               ggtree can read more tree file formats than other softwares,
               including newick, nexus, NHX, phylip and jplace formats, and
               support visualization of phylo, multiphylo, phylo4, phylo4d,
               obkdata and phyloseq tree objects defined in other r packages.
               It can also extract the tree/branch/node‐specific and other data
               from the analysis outputs of beast, epa, hyphy, paml, phylodog,
               pplacer, r8s, raxml and revbayes software, and allows using
               these data to annotate the tree. The package allows colouring
               and annotation of a tree by numerical/categorical node
               attributes, manipulating a tree by rotating, collapsing and
               zooming out clades, highlighting user selected clades or
               operational taxonomic units and exploration of a large tree by
               zooming into a selected portion. A two‐dimensional tree can be
               drawn by scaling the tree width based on an attribute of the
               nodes. A tree can be annotated with an associated numerical
               matrix (as a heat map), multiple sequence alignment, subplots or
               silhouette images. The package ggtree is released under the
               artistic‐2.0 license. The source code and documents are freely
               available through bioconductor
               (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/ggtree).",

  abstract  = "Comparative genomic analyses of primates offer considerable
               potential to define and understand the processes that mold,
               shape, and transform the human genome. However, primate taxonomy
               is both complex and controversial, with marginal unifying
               consensus of the evolutionary hierarchy of extant primate
               species. Here we provide new genomic sequence (~8 Mb) from 186
               primates representing 61 (~90\%) of the described genera, and we
               include outgroup species from Dermoptera, Scandentia, and
               Lagomorpha. The resultant phylogeny is exceptionally robust and
               illuminates events in primate evolution from ancient to recent,
               clarifying numerous taxonomic controversies and providing new
               data on human evolution. Ongoing speciation, reticulate
               evolution, ancient relic lineages, unequal rates of evolution,
               and disparate distributions of insertions/deletions among the
               reconstructed primate lineages are uncovered. Our resolution of
               the primate phylogeny provides an essential evolutionary
               framework with far-reaching applications including: human
               selection and adaptation, global emergence of zoonotic diseases,
               mammalian comparative genomics, primate taxonomy, and
               conservation of endangered species.",
