# Types of Phylogenetic Tree

## Introduction

In this section, we will work through some of the visualisation options available in `iToL` to explore how the same phylogenetic tree can be presented to accentuate different aspects of the data. These options are controlled through the control panel (@fig-itol-control-panel).

![The `iTol` control panel. Options in this menu allow you to change the way the tree is visualised.](assets/images/itol-control-panel.png){#fig-itol-control-panel width=80%}

## Cladograms and Phylograms

The default tree presented by `iToL` (@fig-tree-newick-01) is a _rectangular_ tree.

::: { .callout-note }
You can see from @fig-itol-control-panel that the `Rectangular` mode is selected by default.
:::

Broadly-speaking this means that the tree looks "rectangular" (it has lots of right angles) in a way that other tree representations do not. More specifically, every bifurcation is presented as a kind of "T-junction" where the ancestral lineage splits into two descendant lineages that leave the bifurcation at right angles (@fig-tree-newick-05)

![The default `iToL` view of the uploaded `tree_newick.nwk` tree is a _rectangular_ tree - specifically a _phylogram_.](assets/images/tree-newick-05.png){#fig-itol-tree-newick-05 width=80%}

There are two forms of rectangular tree.

::: { .callout-tip }
1. a tree in which the branch lengths are proportional to the genetic change represented by the tree - this is called a _phylogram_
2. a tree in which the branch lengths carry no meaning, or are an arbitrary length - this is called a _cladogram_
:::

You can toggle between these two forms of _rectangular_ tree in `iTol` by changing the `Branch lengths:` option from `Use` to `Ignore`. A cladogram shows the order of branching events, but does not provide visual information about the genetic change between nodes on the tree (branching events or leaves).

::: { .callout-tip }
**The order of branching events in a tree is referred to as its _topology_.**
:::

![By setting the `Branch lengths:` option to `ignore`, `iToL` will show a _rectangular_ _cladogram_.](assets/images/tree-newick-06.png){#fig-itol-tree-newick-06 width=80%}

## Tree rotation

Rotating a tree does not change its content or the relationships it describes. All four trees in @fig-four-rotated-trees show exactly the same information. These trees were generated by setting the `Rotation` value in the `iToL` control panel (@fig-itol-control-panel).

::: { .callout-tip }
Changing the _scaling_ of the tree (stretching or compressing it in any direction) also does not change the information presented. The trees in @fig-four-rotated trees were scaled horizontally by 50% using the `Advanced` tab of the `iToL` control panel (@fig-itol-control-panel-02).

![180 degrees rotation](assets/images/tree-newick-08.png){#fig-180deg-rot width=80%}

![270 degrees rotation](assets/images/tree-newick-09.png){#fig-270deg-rot height=20% width=80%}

The same cladogram, rotated through 90, 180, and 270 degrees. The tree shows exactly the same information in each rotation.
:::

## Rotating clades

Rotating the members of a clade around their common ancestor also does not affect the content of the tree - and specifically leaves its _topology_ unchanged - even if it makes the tree appear visually quite different. The four trees in @fig-four-rotated-clades have exactly the same topology.

::: {#fig-four-rotated-clades layout-ncol=2}

![The phylogram after rotating the clade containing (`F`, `G`, and `H`) around their common ancestor. This does not change the topology of the tree.](assets/images/tree-newick-12.png){#fig-clade-rot3}

![The phylogram after rotating the clade containing (`A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`) around their common ancestor. This does not change the topology of the tree.](assets/images/tree-newick-13.png){#fig-clade-rot4}

The same cladogram, progressively rotating clades so that node order increases along the tree. The tree shows exactly the same information in each rotation - the _topology_ (branching order) of the tree remains unchanged.
:::

## Non-rectangular trees

Phylogenetic trees do not need to be rectangular and, even if drawn using different forms, still present the same information as their rectangular counterparts.

### Slanted cladogram

The angle formed at each branching event doesn't need to be rectangular (at 90 degrees) - it can be narrower, as in a _slanted cladogram_. @fig-slanted-comparison shows rectangular and slanted cladograms of the same tree. Being cladograms they provide only topology information, and this is the same in both renderings.

::: {#fig-slanted-comparison layout-ncol=2}

![Slanted cladogram.](assets/images/tree-newick-14.png){#fig-rect-clad}

A rectangular and a slanted cladogram of the same phylogenetic tree, presenting identical evolutionary information.
:::

### Circular phylogram

It is increasingly common, as datasets increase in size, to see _circular phylograms_ in publications. These place the root at the centre of a circle and show the branches as radii pointing away from the centre as genetic changes increase.

Rendering a tree in circular form does not change the information being presented, in comparison with a rectangular phylogram, as can be seen in @fig-circular-comparison.

::: {#fig-circular-comparison layout-ncol=2}

::: { .callout-tip title="Pros and cons of circular phylograms" }
**Pros**

- Circular trees are efficient with space 
- Circular trees are especially useful for fitting large trees into a small space, such as a journal page.

**Cons**

- It can be difficult to read the labels on circular trees easily
- Due to the way they are presented, especially for trees with lots of data, it can be difficult to see the branching order of nodes close to the root.
