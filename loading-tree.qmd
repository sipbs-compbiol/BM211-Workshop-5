# Loading a Phylogenetic Tree

## Introduction

As noted in @sec-introduction, you will generally encounter phylogenetic trees as a plain text file in one of a handful of common file formats, such as:

- [`newick`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format), file ending `.new`, `.nwk`, `.newick`
- [`NEXUS`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_file), file ending `.nex`, `.nexus`
- [`phylip`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHYLIP), file ending `.phy`, `.phylip`

Whichever software tool you use to read and visualise your tree, you will need to _load_ the data into that tool. In `iToL` you would need to upload the data to the server. In `figtree` or `dendroscope` you would open the file through a dialogue box. Using `ggtree` in `R`, you would write code to open the file and run commands to visualise it.

In this workshop we will be using the online `iToL` service to visualise and interpret trees. This does not require you to install any software on your machine. The `iToL` service is available at the link below.

## Load your tree data

Your tree data is in a file called `tree_newick.nwk`. This tree file describes a phylogeny with 13 samples, and it should be downloaded to your computer from the link below.

- [**`tree_newick.nwk`**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sipbs-compbiol/BM211-Workshop-5/main/assets/trees/tree_newick.nwk)

::: { .callout-important title="Task" }
Upload the tree file `tree_newick.nwk` to `iToL`.

## I need a hint!

- Click on the `Upload` button (@fig-itol-upload-button) to see the tree file upload page
- Follow the instructions on the page

## Help! I'm stuck!

- Click on the `Upload` button (@fig-itol-upload-button) to see the tree file upload page
- Enter a name for the tree in the `Tree name:` field.
- Click on the `Browse` button, and select your downloaded `tree_newick.nwk` file. The name of the file will appear next to the button.
- Click on the `Upload` button

## Check your result

After uploading the tree, `iTol` should present the default tree view, as in (@fig-itol-tree-newick-01).
