# Loading a Phylogenetic Tree {#sec-itol-load}

## Introduction

As noted in @sec-introduction, you will generally encounter phylogenetic trees as a plain text file in one of a handful of common file formats, such as:

- [`newick`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format), file ending `.new`, `.nwk`, `.newick`
- [`NEXUS`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_file), file ending `.nex`, `.nexus`
- [`phylip`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHYLIP), file ending `.phy`, `.phylip`

Whichever software tool you use to read and visualise your tree, you will need to _load_ the data into that tool. In `iToL` you would need to upload the data to the server. In `figtree` or `dendroscope` you would open the file through a dialogue box. Using `ggtree` in `R`, you would write code to open the file and run commands to visualise it.

::: { .callout-note }
In this workshop we will be using the online `iToL` service to visualise and interpret trees. This does not require you to install any software on your machine. The `iToL` service is available at the link below.

## Load your tree data

Your tree data is in a file called `tree_newick.nwk`. This tree file describes a phylogeny with 13 samples, and it should be downloaded to your computer from the link below.

- [**`tree_newick.nwk`**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sipbs-compbiol/BM211-Workshop-5/main/assets/trees/tree_newick.nwk)

::: { .callout-important title="Task" }
Upload the tree file `tree_newick.nwk` to `iToL`.
:::

## Check your result

After uploading the tree, `iTol` should present the default tree view, as in (@fig-itol-tree-newick-01).

## Understanding your tree

Considering the `newick` file contents you saw in @sec-introduction (and shown below), you might expect that the tree shows relationships between species represented by the letters `A`-`M` in that file:

```text
(((((((A:4,B:4):6,C:5):8,D:6):3,E:21):10,((F:4,G:12):14,H:8):13):13,((I:5,J:2):30,(K:11,L:11):2):17):4,M:56);
```

The tree `iTol` presents at first (@fig-tree-newick-01) shows these relationships. 

![Rectangular phylogram representation of the `tree_newick.nwk` file.](assets/images/tree-newick-01.png){#fig-tree-newick-01 width=80%}

- the tree is a set of _bifurcating branches_ that spread out from the last common ancestor (LCA) and represent an **estimated** evolutionary history
- this is a _rooted tree_, so the last common ancestor (LCA) is considered to be represented at the very far left of the tree, at its _root_
  - **in this tree, _ancestors_ are on the left, and _descendants_ are on the right**
- the horizontal dimension in this plot shows the amount of genetic change since the LCA - less change towards the left-hand side, more towards the right
  - **this tree is a _phylogram_, which means that the lengths of the branches are meaningful and represent the amount of genetic change**

::: { .callout-note }
Branch lengths are usually drawn in units of _nucleotide substitutions per site_ - the estimated total number of nucleotide substitutions, divided by (_normalised to_) the length of the sequence.

You may sometimes see alternative units being used, such as estimated time, or the percentage of sites that have changed.

## Question 01

In @fig-tree-newick-01 which species shows the most genetic change since the LCA?

- `A`
- `E`
- `G`
- `K`
:::

::: { .callout-warning collapse="true" }
## Answer 01

The total distance from the LCA to the leaf node for a species represents the total amount of genetic change. More straightforwardly here, the species whose leaf node is farthest to the right in @fig-tree-newick-01 has accumulated the most genetic change since the LCA. Of the four options presented, the species with greatest genetic change since the LCA is `G`.

### Trees and time

The general relationship between this phylogram and time is shown in @fig-tree-newick-02.

![`iToL` phylogram annotated with _root_, _leaves_, _bifurcations_, and the relationship between ancestors and descendents.](assets/images/tree-newick-02.png){#fig-tree-newick-02 width=80%}

As the tree represents genetic change, and the rate of genetic change may not be constant in all sequences or organisms, we can't immediately interpret branch lengths as time. The best we can sometimes do is - when the sequences/organisms used to build the tree are known to exist _now_ - say that the leaves of the tree approximately represent the current date.

::: { .callout-note }
There are phylogenetic techniques that allow us to convert genetic distances into approximate times, but they are beyond the scope of this workshop.
:::

- **currently existing species (`A`-`M`) - the input for building the tree - are shown at the _leaves_** (or _leaf nodes_) of the tree, at the ends of the _branches_
- the branching events (_bifurcations_) show how evolutionary lineages split, as the amount of genetic change increases from left to right; they represent events in evolution where a population divides into two subgroups with different genetic histories
  - **in a biological context, this process is often referred to as _speciation_**
  - **the order of bifurcation can be interpreted as the order in which speciation events occurred**
- the amount of genetic change between branching events is represented by the length of the branch that separates them; the scale bar allows you to interpret the branch length quantitatively

::: { .callout-important collapse="true" }
## Question 02

@fig-tree-newick-01 implies that which speciation event was the earliest?

- the speciation separating `A` and `B`
- the speciation separating `B` and `C`
- the speciation separating `B` and `D`
- the speciation separating `C` and `E`
:::

::: { .callout-warning collapse="true" }
## Answer 02

We have to be careful with the interpretation because the **lengths of branches represent genetic change, not time**. However, moving from left to right we can see that `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and `E` derived from a single common ancestor. The order in which the individual species emerged is the order of speciations from left to right in this tree. So, `E` diverged first, then `D`, `C`, `B` and `A` in that order. The earliest specietion is the one involving species `E`, so the answer is the speciation separating `C` and `E`.

### Ancestry and history

Phylogenetic trees represent patterns of shared ancestry and history between lineages. For instance, in @fig-tree-newick-03 common and unique ancestors of `A`, `B` and `C` are indicated, as are common and unique histories of `I` and `J`.

![`iToL` phylogram annotated with unique and shared ancestries and histories. Ancestors are single points on a branch (represented here as boxes), whereas histories are the entire set of ancestors represented by a branch.](assets/images/tree-newick-03.png){#fig-tree-newick-03 width=80%}

::: { .callout-important collapse="true" }
## Question 03

In @fig-tree-newick-01 which of the following accumulated the greatest amount of genetic change?

- the unique history of `E`
- the shared history of `I` and `J`
- the shared history of `I`, `J`, `K`, and `L`
- the unique history of `D`
:::

::: { .callout-warning collapse="true" }
## Answer 03

From those listed, the branch that accumulated the most genetic change is the longest of the branches. The shared history of `I` and `J` is the longest of these, so has accumulated the most genetic change.
:::

### Clades

A _clade_ is a grouping on the tree that includes a common ancestor and all of its descendants. We call a group with these properties _monpphyletic_ (i.e. it comprises a single phylum). @fig-tree-newick-04 shows examples of clades in the `iToL` tree you generated. 

![`iToL` phylogram annotated with _clades_, groupings on the tree that include a common ancestor and all its descendants. Clades can be _nested_ inside each other as a hierarchy. Clade4 (`A`, `B`, `C`) is completely contained within Clade3 (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`).](assets/images/tree-newick-04.png){#fig-tree-newick-04 width=80%}

::: { .callout-important collapse="true" }
## Question 04

In @fig-tree-newick-01 which of the following groups of leaf nodes form a _clade_?

1. (`J`, `K`, `L`)
2. (`F`, `G`, `H`)
3. (`D`, `E`)
4. (`K`, `L`)

- all of the groups form a clade
- only groups 1 and 4 form clades
- only groups 2 and 4 form clades
- only group 1 forms a clade
- only group 2 forms a clade
- only group 3 forms a clade
- only group 4 forms a clade
- only groups 2 and 3 form clades
- none of the groups form a clade
:::

::: { .callout-warning collapse="true" }
## Answer 04

Group 1, (`J`, `K`, `L`) does not form a clade because the common ancestor of these species also has `I` as a descendent, and it is not included in the group.

Group 2, (`F`, `G`, `H`) forms a clade (see @fig-tree-newick-04).

Group 3, (`D`, `E`) does not form a clade because the common ancestor of these species also has `A` , `B`, and `C` as descendents, and they are not included in the group.

Group 4, (`K`, `L`) does form a clade as `K`, `L` and all descendants from their common ancestor are included.

Thus, the answer is **only groups 2 and 4 form clades**.
